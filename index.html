				<h3>Brian Flyers</h3>
				<img class="author-img" src="img/BrianFlyers.png"/>
				<p>
				As a child, he was always smarter than is classmates. He
				always new what was going on. When the teacher's water
				got knocked over, he knew that it was the government
				sending out shockwaves to ward off aliens.
				</p>

			<div class="author-right">
				<h3>Luke Groundwalker</h3>
				<img class="author-img" src="img/LukeGroundwalker.png"/>
				<p>
				When Luke was a child, he never thought that he would ever
				think that UFO's were real. But, it all changed when he got
				sucked up into a UFO right after his brain surgery.<br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h3>Wally Mart</h3>
				<img class="author-img" src="img/WallyMart.png"/>
				<p>
				Wally is a bright guy. By bright, I mean radioactive. When he
				was young, he found an alien spaceship and he was around it
				too long, and that made him have a peculiar glow. His
				brother started to glow, too.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="author-right">
				<h3>Jane</h3>
				<img class="author-img" src="img/Jane.png"/>
				<p>
				Jane is... Jane. She is just crazy. She is known for her
				math problems. An example, "The speed limit is 50mph. Jane went
				110mph. How many miles per hour is Jane going over the speed limit?"
				We kinda figured she'd be an accountant, but she wanted to write.
